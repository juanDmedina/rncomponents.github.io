# Structure

- For this project we will use atomic design.


![Example](/rncomponents.github.io/docs/assets/atom-design.png)

1. Atoms: These are the building blocks, which cannot be further broken down
1. Molecules: Atoms grouped together form a single molecule
1. Organisms: Molecules joined together to create a part of the interface
1. Templates: The content structure
1. Pages: Interfaces built as instances of templates
